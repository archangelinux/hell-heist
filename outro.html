    <span class="type" id = "pt1" style="--n:250; animation-play-state: running">YOU DID IT!! But as you make your way back from the bank, you see your little gang standing on your lawn. They bring you to your basement, put a knife to your throat, and force you to split your earnings with them.</span>

        The time glitch (or was it the brain workout?) also made you pretty buff so you fight them off easily.<br>
        <br><br>Then you pull out of your pocket…     <br>
        A high school math Study Guide…       <br>

        CONGRATULATION AGAIN FOR MAKING IT BACK! <br>
        But that's not why I'm so happy for you. I just witnessed the most moving character development in a long time. You really have worked on yourself! - resisting the urge to shoplift and actually budgeting and paying for gas. See what math can do to a person? Man, I'm shedding tears already. Good luck on your future endeavors, but I doubt you'll need it.
        <br>Signing off - Your critical alt.
