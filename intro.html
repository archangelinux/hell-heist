    <span class="type" id = "pt2" style="--n:232; animation-play-state: paused;">Alright, alright. Says the drop-out full-time con artist. Ahem.
        I would have said that you are a successful one, but that would be lying since your crew just deserted you 5 miles back and drove off in your newly-stolen Honda Civic. </span>
    <button id = "button2" style = "animation-play-state: paused;">Can you get to the point?</button><br><br>
    <span class="type" id = "pt3" style="--n:507; animation-play-state: paused;">Okay! My point is.. you just need to stop your fishy gig and get a ride home. Your crew may have left you alone, but they did forget to take a peculiar-looking key card that matches a very sleek car parked right before you.
        I hope you're talented enough to pull this off! <br> Anyways I'm already using too much of your brainpower - no more chit-chat for now. I'll leave it to you.<br> Good luck - From your critical alt</span>
