    <p>Wow! See what I mean? - you really do have the brains! It nearly took you all day but…wait a minute! The sun is barely over the horizon, yet looking at your phone, it's 10:40am!! Something is really off, so you hurriedly hit the gas and go on your way. 
     <br>Your slightly irritating friend calls you. You’re about to pick up the phone, but you come across a very warped roadway in some absurd dimensional glitch. It suddenly hits you that something about starting this car must have played with time…you’re time travelling. So much for getting home.
      <br><br>
      The hills you must drive over are modeled by the function h = 6 sin [4 ( d - 22.5 deg ) + 6], (where h = height in m, d = distance in m), but you can only receive signals when you are above 9 metres. To complicate things, each time your cell phone loses signal, your phone battery abruptly drops 15% (you’re lost in time). 
      

        <div class = "form">
    
            <p>As you begin driving the hills, how long do you have before your phone dies if it is currently at 42% and it takes you 10 minute to drive uphill and 5 minutes downhill both at a constant horizontal velocity (assume your driving speed is unaffected by the time glitch, and round to 2 d.p.)?</p>
